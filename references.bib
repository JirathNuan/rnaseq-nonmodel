	abstract = {The protocols used for library construction, sequencing and data pre-processing can have a great impact on the quality of an assembled transcriptome and the accuracy of gene expression quantification.Before starting an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment, one should carefully consider using protocols that are strand-specific, that remove ribosomal RNA and that do not require PCR amplification of the template.Strand-specific RNA-seq protocols are important for correctly assembling overlapping transcripts, especially for compact genomes.The reference-based, or ab initio, assembly strategy requires a reference genome and uses much fewer computing resources than the de novo strategy. However, the quality of the genome and the ability of the short-read aligner to align reads across introns will directly influence the accuracy of the assembled transcripts when using the reference-based strategy.The de novo assembly strategy does not use a reference genome but instead uses a De Bruijn graph to represent overlaps between sequences and assemble transcripts. Most de novo approaches require significant computing resources: random access memory (RAM) is the typical limitation. However, de novo assemblers can assemble trans-spliced genes and novel transcripts that are not present in the genome assembly.To take full advantage of the current assembly strategies, a combined assembly approach should be considered that leverages the strengths of reference-based and de novo assembly strategies.Most transcriptome assemblers are still being developed, and the results from these programs should be evaluated using unbiased quantitative metrics.Transcriptome assembly involves an informatics approach to solve an experimental limitation. As sequencing strategies continually improve, it may no longer be necessary in the near future to assemble transcriptomes, as the read length will be longer than any individual transcript.},
