# Bash Command Language for Biologists

Shell scripting (or shell or UNIX) are heavily used in bioinformatics, which has been the interface for large bioinformatics programs. Throughout this workshop, you'll learn how to use the necessary bash command concepts. This will allow you to focus on the content of commands in future chapters, rather than be preoccupied with understanding shell syntax. But before we start to learn bash, it's good to understand the linux file systems a bit.

## Linux File Systems

Adopted from [linux-file-hierarchy-structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-hierarchy-structure), In Unix-like operating systems, the Linux File System defines the directory structure and contents. Even if they're on different physical or virtual disks, all files and directories are under the root directory.

Root (`/`)

:   It is the root directory of the entire file system hierarchy and the primary hierarchy root. The root directory is where everything starts. This directory can only be written by root.

/bin

:   Essential commands that need to be available in all users, for example, `cat`, `ls`, `cp`, `cd`, `top`, `mkdir` and many more.

/dev

:   Essential device files such as `/dev/null`, `/dev/shm`. These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.

/etc

:   System-wide configuration files for the host, contain files all programs need. Also included are startup and shutdown shell scripts for starting and stopping individual programs, such as `/etc/fstab` for permanently mounting external disks, `/etc/netplan` for configuring the network and IP address, and more.

/home

:   The home directories of users, where they keep their saved files and settings. These directories are used to store all of a user's files and settings in one place, making it easy for them to access their data and keep it organized. For example `/home/ponsit`, `/home/jiratchaya`, `/home/prasert`.

/lib

:   Contain essential libraries for the binaries in `/bin/` and `/sbin/`.

/media

:   Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (deprecated).

/mnt

:   Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount file systems, such as `/mnt/external_disk_1`, `/mnt/removable_drive_1`, etc.

/opt

:   Optional application software packages. Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.

/sbin

:   Essential system binaries, e.g., `fsck`, `init`, route.

/tmp

:   Temporary files that aren't preserved between reboots, and may be severely limited.

/usr

:   A secondary hierarchy for read-only user data. The majority of utilities and apps are in here.

## Basic Bash Commands

Bash is a Unix shell that allows you to enter commands, which are then interpreted and run by the computer. Commands can be used to perform tasks, such as creating a directory, running a program, or deleting a file. Bash is a type of interpreter, which takes user input and converts it into a language that the computer can understand and execute. Commands are typically composed of keywords, arguments, and flags, which allow the user to control how the command is interpreted and executed by the computer.

-   **Navigating your file system**

The file system manages files and directories in the operating system, as shown in the diagram above. It organizes our data into files, which store information, and directories.

    jiratchaya@pslab1:~$

The dollar sign `$` is a prompt, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input. Your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before the prompt.

-   **Find out where we are now**

<!-- -->

    pwd

pwd stand for print working directory. Without explicitly specifying something else, the computer assumes we want to run commands in our current working directory. Which can be a user's home directory (`~`).

-   **Changing directory**

<!-- -->

    cd your_target_directory

Which stands for change directory. You can change our working directory by typing `cd` followed by a directory name. In this case, you care changing from the current directory to the directory named `your_target_directory`.

-   **Listing directories**

We can see files and subdirectories are in this directory by running ls, which stands for "listing":

    ls

Let's see in the different way. This way is to list all files and directories including user who belong to, permissions, and file size in bytes.

    ls -l

To list files and folders, permissions, and size in human-readable format.

    ls -lh

See all hidden files and directories

    ls -a
    # or
    ls -la
